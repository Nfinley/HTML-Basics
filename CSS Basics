/* CSS BASICS
This file contains basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) learned through Codecademy
In order to to link HTML file to CSS sheet you must create a link within the HTML file to the CSS file
The 'link'has three parts, 'type' that should always be equal to 'text/css', 'rel' attribute that should be equal to 'stylesheet' 
and 'href' that should link to your css file, see below */
  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="CSS file address"/> The link tag is also self closing just like the img tag

/* CSS SYNTAX */

Basic syntax is as follows: 

selector {
    property: value;
}

<!-- The 'selector' can be any html element such as <p>, <img> or <table> 
The 'property'is an aspect of 'selector', you can change things like 'font-family', 'color' and 'font-size'
The 'value' is a possible setting for a 'property', ie: the 'font' can be blue, red or black and the 'font-family' 
can be arial, etc. Each property value must end with  ';'-->


/* This is the format for a CSS comment */

/* Color types: Hexadecimal, Pixels, and EMs

/* Hexadecimal colors are six digits and can be digits from 0 to 9 and letters a to f. 

Ems: The font-size unit em is a relative measure: one em is equal to the default font size on whatever screen the user is using.
1em is the normal font size and 2em is twice the size. 

*/

/* Links and TEXT DECORATION
Within CSS stylesheet you can decorate links, ie: 
text-decoration: none (this removes the underline standard on a hyperlink) 

To add CSS styling to every element you can use * as a selector 

In order to style an element directly inside another element or their direct children you can do this: 
div > p { /* Some CSS */ }
*/


/* IDs and CLASSES within CSS 

CLASS: 
CLASSes are great when you have a group of elements that need the same styling
Within HTML it looks like <div class="header"></div>
To identify a CLASS in the CCS stylesheet you use a (.) 
For example: 
.header {
  height: 100px;
  width: 50px;
  }
  
  ID:
  IDs on the other hand are great when you have exactly one element that needs styling
  They are assigned in HTML like this: <div id="header"></div>
  ID's are identified in the CSS stylesheet with a pound sign (#).
  For example: 
  #header {
    height: 100px;
  }
  Applies to a single instance instead of an entire class
  */
  
  /* Pseudo Class Selectors
  Allows you to access HTML elements that are not part of the document tree, like changing a link when you hover over it
  It's the colon after the selector that makes it a pseudo selector. See below:
  selector:pseudo-class_selector {
    property: value;
} 
For example: 

a:hover {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
Here are some useful pseudo selectors: 
a:link: An unvisited link.
a:visited: A visited link.
a:hover: A link you're hovering your mouse over.
p:first-child {
    color: red;
} This makes the first child red. 
:nth-child(#) : Allows you to style any child in the html
