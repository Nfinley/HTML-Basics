/* CSS BASICS
This file contains basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) learned through Codecademy
In order to to link HTML file to CSS sheet you must create a link within the HTML file to the CSS file
The 'link'has three parts, 'type' that should always be equal to 'text/css', 'rel' attribute that should be equal to 'stylesheet' 
and 'href' that should link to your css file, see below */
  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="CSS file address"/> The link tag is also self closing just like the img tag

/* CSS SYNTAX */

Basic syntax is as follows: 

selector {
    property: value;
}

<!-- The 'selector' can be any html element such as <p>, <img> or <table> 
The 'property'is an aspect of 'selector', you can change things like 'font-family', 'color' and 'font-size'
The 'value' is a possible setting for a 'property', ie: the 'font' can be blue, red or black and the 'font-family' 
can be arial, etc. Each property value must end with  ';'-->


/* This is the format for a CSS comment */

/* Color types: Hexadecimal, Pixels, and EMs

/* Hexadecimal colors are six digits and can be digits from 0 to 9 and letters a to f. 

Ems: The font-size unit em is a relative measure: one em is equal to the default font size on whatever screen the user is using.
1em is the normal font size and 2em is twice the size. 

*/

/* Links and TEXT DECORATION
Within CSS stylesheet you can decorate links, ie: 
text-decoration: none (this removes the underline standard on a hyperlink) */
