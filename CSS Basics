<!-- CSS BASICS -->
<!-- This file contains basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) learned through Codecademy -->
<!-- In order to to link HTML file to CSS sheet you must create a link within the HTML file to the CSS file-->
<!-- The 'link'has three parts, 'type' that should always be equal to 'text/css', 'rel' attribute that should be equal to 'stylesheet' 
and 'href' that should link to your css file, see below-->
  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="CSS file address"/> The link tag is also self closing just like the img tag
  
<!-- CSS SYNTAX-->

Basic syntax is as follows: 
selector {
    property: value;
}

<!-- The 'selector' can be any html element such as <p>, <img> or <table> 
The 'property'is an aspect of 'selector', you can change things like 'font-family', 'color' and 'font-size'
The 'value' is a possible setting for a 'property', ie: the 'font' can be blue, red or black and the 'font-family' 
can be arial, etc. Each property value must end with  ';'-->
